# HW2
Create a class named Pizza with data fields for description (such as sausage and onion) and 
price. Include a constructor that requires arguments for both fields and a method to display the 
data. Create a subclass named DeliveryPizza that inherits from Pizz a but adds a delivery fee and 
a delivery address. The description, price, and delivery address are required as arguments to 
the constructor. The delivery fee is $2 if the pizza ordered costs more than $20;  otherwise it is 
$5. Write an application that instantiates at least two objects of each type, and display the 
values. Save the files as Pizza.java, DeliveryPizza.java, and DemoPizzas.java. (60 points)
